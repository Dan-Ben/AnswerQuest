      <p>This project was created in second year for our project module. It is an interactive educational website called AnswerQuest in which students can answer questions set out by teachers who admin the questions on the site. The webapp allows teachers to change the questions in browser by either selecting from a preset list of questions which could be modified to match student curriculums  or the teacher can input their own questions. This is done through a combination of XML, XSL and PHP.</p>
